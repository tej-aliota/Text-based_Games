# Text-based_Games

This week we worked on a shape generator.
It was using turtle which is something we were 
already familiar with. I started out making rectangles
and ovals. The hardpart for me is to center the shapes
with the cordinates. Also we watched a lot of videos on text
based games like the oregon trails. It is a fun game but
it is all 2d and relies on inputting text instead of 
other things.

This is a small part of a text based game I was working on.
